/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *  The setting for the game is the home of a toddler, and the object of 
 *  the game will (after implementation) be to find the toddler in one 
 *  of the rooms before pink glittery havok is wrought.
 *  
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
